1.3

o added function for computing generalized eigenvalues from a generalized Schur decomposition
o introduced S3 classes and methods for calculating generalized
  eigenvalues from the generalized Schur decomposition
o documentation tweaks and clarifications
o added Copyright field in DESCRIPTION

1.2

o added Lapack Licence
o added alpha and beta to return list of geigen() and gqz() for safe calculation of generalized eigenvalues
o improved sorting eigenvalues for singular matrix B
o improved calculation of eigenvalues for singular B matrix in geigen()
o detailed Lapack error/informative messages
o option 'R' in gqz() didn't function correctly.
  Corrected errors and now uses a tolerance for testing zero imaginary part.

1.1

o corrected error message in gqz()
o stricter test of sorting for gqz()
o modified all intermediate Fortran subroutines to have integer arguments
  which are transferred to character*1 variables for calling the actual Lapack subroutines
  since on some platforms the Fortran runtime did not accept character in routines called by R
o renamed src/xdgg.f to src/xdggev.f

1.0

o initial version
