2.3

o removed various Lapack routines that are now included in the R Lapack sources.
o changed dependency on the version of R (>= 3.5.0)

2.2

o changed package documentation .Rd to update metadata
o updated lapack routines to version 3.8.0; many Fortran routines unchanged from Lapack 3.7.0.
  Changes are minimal.

2.1

o clarification in documentation of geigen about when the second matrix must be positive definite.
o corrected documentation of gqz; matrices need not be positive definite.

2.0

o register native routines in dll
o added NeedsCompilation field to DESCRIPTION
o use subroutines from Lapack 3.7.0 (no differences in actual code)

1.9.2

o in all files src/x*.f obsolescent Fortran character* declarations replaced
o in all files src/x*.f use <double complex> instead of <complex*16> but
  Lapack routines using <complex*16> have not been changed

1.9.1

o moved zheg* routines to separate file
o updated Lapack routines to version 3.6.1
o documentation tweaks

1.9

o update to routines from Lapack 3.6.0 and use new gsvd routines
o Lapack zzgsvd3 and zzgsvp3 from svn revision 1664 and 1671

1.8

o gsvd now also handles complex matrices

1.7

o documentation tweaks
o gsvd does not handle complex matrices
o removed CITATION and let it be auto generated (to get details correct)

1.6

o added a Generalized Singular Value Decomposition of a matrix pair
o documentation tweaks

1.5

o change to titlecase in several places and update CITATION
o additional comments in cmplxdiv.R about weird complex division on some systems

1.4

o replaced zgetc2 in zggesall.f with Lapack 3.5.0 version
o additional tests
o fix some ftnchek warning/error messages

1.3

o added function for computing generalized eigenvalues from a generalized Schur decomposition
o introduced S3 classes and methods for calculating generalized
  eigenvalues from the generalized Schur decomposition
o added Copyright field in DESCRIPTION
o documentation tweaks and clarifications

1.2

o added Lapack Licence
o added alpha and beta to return list of geigen() and gqz() for safe calculation of generalized eigenvalues
o improved sorting eigenvalues for singular matrix B
o improved calculation of eigenvalues for singular B matrix in geigen()
o detailed Lapack error/informative messages
o option 'R' in gqz() didn't function correctly.
  Corrected errors and now uses a tolerance for testing zero imaginary part.

1.1

o corrected error message in gqz()
o stricter test of sorting for gqz()
o modified all intermediate Fortran subroutines to have integer arguments
  which are transferred to character*1 variables for calling the actual Lapack subroutines
  since on some platforms the Fortran runtime did not accept character in routines called by R
o renamed src/xdgg.f to src/xdggev.f

1.0

o initial version
